## ‚ÑπÔ∏è What Is This Hub?

This repository serves as my **Frontend Project Hub** ‚Äî a centralized place where I showcase all of my web development projects. Each project now lives in its **own dedicated repository** to make deployment, collaboration, and documentation easier.

Every project you see here represents a piece of my learning journey ‚Äî from basic HTML structures to responsive layouts, dynamic JavaScript, and accessible interfaces.

---

## üîç Overview

This hub reflects my journey as a **self-taught frontend developer**. Each project I built is treated as a real-world deliverable ‚Äî with its own README, live deployment, documentation, and purpose.

I started as someone who barely knew what an `<html>` was, and this hub is a living, evolving testament to the time and effort I've put into learning web development properly.

## üéØ Future Goals

Here's what I'm working towards:

- Land my first job in frontend web development
- Do freelancing to further strengthen my frontend skills.
- Learn more by building web applications that solve real-world problems
- Strengthen my accessibility and performance skills along the way
- Study latest trends on programming languages
- Contribute to open source or freelance projects
- Possibly branch out and continue learning to becoming a full stack web developer, or even becoming an AI engineer

## üß† What This Hub Taught Me

- Project structure matters, especially when using Git, GitHub, and Netlify
- Managing multiple repos teaches me how teams work in real environments
- Version control, commits, and pushing to remotes became second nature
- Deployment pipelines and visual preview tags are essential for showcasing work professionally

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Used So Far

- **HTML5**, **CSS3**, **JavaScript**
- **Visual Studio Code**
- **Git** & **GitHub** (via CLI & GitHub Desktop)
- **Netlify** for live deployments
- **Figma** or design images to code translation
- **Markdown** for documentation
