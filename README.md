## ℹ️ A Compilation of My Frontend Projects

This repository contains the projects I built during my journey into frontend web development — starting from scratch with pure HTML, moving into CSS styling, and finally learning how to bring it all to life with JavaScript.

Each project reflects a specific step in my learning: from semantic markup and layout, to interactivity, responsiveness, and accessibility.

---

## 🔍 Overview

These projects demonstrate my ability to:

- Translate design ideas into working websites
- Write clean, maintainable code using semantic HTML5
- Style layouts with CSS3 and media queries
- Add interactivity with vanilla JavaScript
- Apply accessibility best practices using ARIA roles and attributes
- Build responsive websites from PDF designs, Figma links, and mobile-first approaches
- Iterate, reflect, and improve my code quality over time

## 📚 Projects Directory

- 📁 [HTML Projects](./HTML/) — Basic semantic structure, lists, tables, and forms.
